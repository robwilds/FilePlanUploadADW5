## Setup

Install the Nx CLI tool:

```sh
npm install --global nx@latest
```

In the project root folder, create an `.env` file:

```bash
BASE_URL="<url>"
```

## Running

Run the following commands to run either `admin-cc` or `content-ee`:

```bash
npm install
npm start <admin-cc|content-ee>
```

The application is served and opened at `http://localhost:4200` by default.

## Building

Use one of the following commands to build the application for distribution:

```bash
# develop build
npm run build <admin-cc|content-ee>

# Production build
npm run build <admin-cc|content-ee> -- --prod
```

## Composing Plugins for ADW

You can also pick which plugins get into the final build by running:

```shell
# select the plugins and build the ADW app
npm run compose-build

# select the plugins and serve the ADW app
npm run compose-serve
```

You can also use the following command to serve the app with a custom set of plugins:

```bash
nx compose content-ee
```

You can select one, multiple, or all available plugins:

```shell
ADW Compose v0.1.0

❯◯ Alfresco Office Services (AOS)
 ◯ Alfresco About
 ◯ Analytics
 ◯ Content Services
 ◯ Governance
 ◯ Office365
```

## Distributing Applications

Run the `pack` command to create a distributable artifacts:

```bash
nx pack admin-cc
nx pack admin-cc --configuration=production

nx pack content-ee
nx pack content-ee --configuration=production
```

Which produces the following output:

```bash
dist/artifacts/alfresco-control-center-7.8.0.sha1
dist/artifacts/alfresco-control-center-7.8.0.zip

dist/artifacts/alfresco-digital-workspace-4.0.0-A.2.sha1
dist/artifacts/alfresco-digital-workspace-4.0.0-A.2.zip
```

To verify the distribution:

```bash
shasum --check alfresco-control-center-7.8.0.sha1
```

## Unit Tests

Use the following command to run the unit tests:

```bash
nx test <project name>
```

### Code Coverage

Use the following command to run tests with code coverage report:

```bash
# Generate code coverage for a specific project
nx test <project name> --codeCoverage

# Generate code coverage for everything
nx affected:test -- --all --code-coverage
```

## Upgrading Dependencies

To upgrade to the latest versions of ADF and ACA dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
npm run adf-update
```

That is an interactive script that allows you to pick from the following options to upgrade:
